# Recoil â€“ My Notes  

Iâ€™ve started learning **Recoil** for state management in React, and hereâ€™s what I practiced and built.  
This was my first time working with atoms, selectors, and async data in Recoil, and I tested out multiple features step by step. âš¡  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ What I built  
I worked on **five main examples** while exploring Recoil:  

1. **Atoms + Selectors (Basic Notifications)**  
   - Created atoms for `network`, `messages`, and `jobs`.  
   - Combined them with a **selector** to calculate total notifications.  
   - Displayed them in a `TopBar` component.  

2. **useRecoilState**  
   - Learned how to both **read and update** atom values.  
   - Added buttons to increment jobs, messages, and network counts.  
   - Used `setState(prev => prev + 1)` pattern with Recoil atoms.  

3. **useSetRecoilState**  
   - Explored updating state without reading it.  
   - Split UI into two parts: one showing values, another (`ButtonUpdater`) updating atoms.  
   - Saw how `useRecoilValue` + `useSetRecoilState` can be combined for efficiency.  

4. **Async Selectors (Fetching Data)**  
   - Created a Recoil atom whose default value comes from a **selector with async axios call**.  
   - Automatically fetched notification data from an API.  
   - Combined counts with a selector to calculate `totalNotificationCount`.  
   - Learned that selectors can return promises and work seamlessly.  

5. **Atom Families + Selector Families**  
   - Practiced with `atomFamily` and `selectorFamily`.  
   - Built a dynamic todo example: `todosAtomFamily(id)` fetches data for specific todo IDs.  
   - Rendered multiple Todo components with their own data.  
   - Understood how families make scalable state management possible.

## ðŸ§  Why Recoil?  
- Makes **global state** management much simpler than prop drilling.  
- Atoms = pieces of state â†’ can be shared across components.  
- Selectors = derived/computed state â†’ no duplication, logic stays clean.  
- Async selectors integrate fetching logic directly into state layer.  
- Atom/selector families scale well for apps with multiple items (e.g., todos, products).

## ðŸ”© My Mental Model  
- Atoms â†’ hold state
- Selectors â†’ derive/combine/async fetch
- Components â†’ subscribe to atoms/selectors with hooks
