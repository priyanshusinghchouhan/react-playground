# ⚛️ React Playground  

Welcome to **React Playground** 🎉 – a collection of my hands-on learning, experiments, and mini-projects while mastering **React.js**.  
This repo isn’t just about projects – it’s about understanding the **core building blocks** of React and how to apply them in real-world apps.

## 🧩 What You'll Find Here  

### 🎯 Core React Concepts
- ✅ **Hooks** – useState, useEffect, useReducer, useRef, useMemo, useCallback  
- ✅ **Custom Hooks** – Reusable logic for cleaner code  
- ✅ **Props & Prop Drilling** – Passing data across components  
- ✅ **Context API** – Global state sharing without prop drilling  

### ⚡ State Management
- ✅ **Recoil.js** – Atoms, selectors, atomFamily, selectorFamily, async selectors  
- ✅ **Local State vs Global State** – Choosing the right tool for the job  

### 🛠️ Advanced React Patterns
- ⚙️ Performance optimization with **React.memo**  
- ⚙️ Component composition & reusability  
- ⚙️ Controlled vs uncontrolled components

## 🚀 Why This Repo?  
I created this repo as a **React learning hub** to push every piece of code I write while exploring:  
- Small utilities, demos, and hook experiments  
- State management patterns & best practices  
- Reusable code snippets to quickly plug into projects

## 🌟 Road Ahead  
- 🔄 Integrating React with **backend APIs** (Node.js/Express, MongoDB)  
- 🔮 Exploring **Next.js** for production-ready apps  
- 🧠 Diving into **GenAI + React integrations**  

---

📌 This repo will keep growing as I continue experimenting and building **React + AI + Fullstack projects**. Stay tuned 🚀
